# CodeAlpha_StudentGradeTracker
This is a project I build while doing internship for 'CodeAlpha' a software company . To make things simple I used console to display the result. This project is made using ArrayList and OOP concept of Java . This stores the information of student and marks using an ArrayList and displays the max , min , average marks of the students as well as the number of students . 
Thanks to CodeAlpha for this giving me the opportunity to work in this project .
